charitable capital by investing their accounts in loans to nonprofits.
Interest payments grow the ALF pool and donor accounts, recycling

engaged the Capstone team to analyze how the loan program
could increase its utilization and impact. After conducting desktop
research, a stakeholder analysis, and data analysis, the team found
that the ALF’s low utilization rate is primarily due to high interest
rates to nonprofit borrowers, both in relation to the ALF’s ten-
year historical rates and to those of alternative lenders. The team

INSTITUTIONS IN TANZANIA","The United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the UN’s
capital investment agency for the least developed countries, offers
“last mile” finance models that unlock public and private resources
to reduce poverty and support local economic development. UNCDF
engaged the Capstone team to conduct a case study of Tanzania
with a focus on the achievements and challenges faced by local
governments in financing for sustainable development, in line with
policy areas laid out in the Malaga Global Coalition for Municipal
Finance. The team conducted background research and a literature

2058,WORLD BANK,"ADVANCING GENDER-RESPONSIVE PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AND BUDGETING","The World Bank’s Governance Global Practice (GGP) works with
countries facing governance issues to build capable, transparent,
and inclusive institutions. Governments use Gender-Responsive
Public Financial Management (GRPFM), also known as Gender-
Responsive Budgeting (GRB), to ensure that fiscal decisions promote
gender equality and address persisting inequalities. However,
gender disparities persist worldwide and targets for Sustainable
Development Goal 5—reaching gender equality and empowering all
women and girls—are far from being met. GGP enlisted the Capstone
team to assess GRPFM reforms in select countries and uncover
the governance and institutional factors impacting GRB adoption
and effectiveness. The team conducted extensive desk research
and consultations with GRB experts. The final report highlights the
causes of gender-blind budget systems in many countries, despite
national and international commitments, and opportunities to
enhance the implementation of GRPFM reforms.","ITL, MGT",Paul Smoke,"Lex Brierley

2059,WORLD BANK,MUNICIPAL FINANCING STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT IN INDONESIA,"The Urban Team of the World Bank aims to bridge the infrastructure
gap in Indonesia by improving infrastructure and public service
delivery at the subnational level through loans, technical assistance,
and capacity building. The World Bank enlisted a Capstone team to
identify the infrastructure needs and priorities of two Indonesian
cities: Jakarta and Bandung. The team analyzed financing needs,
economic conditions, fiscal capacity, institutional capacity, and policy
constraints, and identified stakeholders and suitable financing for
selected development areas. The team’s assessment of infrastructure
funding strategies revealed that an integrated financing framework
could help reduce existing financing gaps, in furtherance of which
the team collected data to assess and diagnose the financing and
expenditure strategy. The team’s final report pinpoints relevant
stakeholders for each infrastructure project and highlights potential
own-source revenues to optimize local revenues.","ITL, MGT",Paul Smoke,"Jonathan Ahn

services in Kenya’s participating counties. The World Bank enlisted
the Capstone team to address the urgent challenge of coastal and
shoreline degradation in Mombasa County, focusing on the use
of nature-based solutions for mangrove restoration. The team
reviewed current environmental protection frameworks, legislation,
and restoration efforts by local actors. After engaging with the
County’s government and community-based organizations, the team
identified existing gaps and opportunities in waste management,
livelihood diversification, data innovation, and integrated spatial
planning. The team also researched actionable financial objectives to
address the challenges facing mangrove restoration in the County.
The team’s deliverables included an inception report, a detailed
account of fieldwork findings, and a final recommendation for
sustainable mangrove rehabilitation to coordinate with the County

2061,BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCORING,IMPACT OF NYC LOCAL LAW 33 ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS,"The Capstone team investigated the impact of public efficiency
grade disclosure on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among large
buildings in New York City. Leveraging data from the NYC Energy
& Water Performance Map, the team analyzed 48,334 buildings
over 25,000 square feet in floor area that received efficiency labels
between fiscal years 2018 and 2022. Employing a difference-in-
difference framework with a cutpoint of 69 (Letter Grade C), the
team compared emissions changes in buildings falling just below
and above this threshold. The team’s analysis incorporates robust
regression techniques, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and
models with Robust Standard Errors, to examine the relationship
between energy efficiency (as measured by Energy Star Scores)
and GHG emissions. Preliminary findings suggest that higher
efficiency scores are significantly associated with lower emissions,
underscoring the potential of efficiency grading as a policy tool for
reducing environmental impacts. Further research explores causal
relationships through additional data visualizations and comparative
analyses of treatment and control groups.",RQA,"Erilia Wu

2062,CASH BAIL REFORM AND CRIME RATES IN NYC,"EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF CASH BAIL REFORM AND SUBSEQUENT
ROLLBACKS ON OVERALL CRIME RATES","In 2019, New York State lawmakers approved legislation eliminating
the use of cash bail for the majority of misdemeanors and select
lesser felonies. Politicians and other government officials have
vocally opposed the legislation since its implementation in January
2020, claiming it led to increased crime rates throughout the City.
New York State approved two rollbacks of this legislation in 2020
and 2022, expanding the scope of charges eligible for bail and other
special considerations. The Capstone team examined the effect of
cash bail reform and its subsequent rollbacks on overall crime rates
in NYC by using publicly available data on City crime rates. Using a
difference-in-difference method, the team’s findings provide insight
into whether cash bail reform actually decreases the overall crime
rate and what policy implications the rollbacks have for overall
crime.",RQA,"Erilia Wu

2063,"EVICTION MORATORIUMS AND LABOR MARKET
OUTCOMES","AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF A PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM ON
SCHOOL CLIMATE","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted unprecedented measures to
curb community spread of the virus and socioeconomic instability,
including eviction moratoriums at both the state and federal levels.
The Capstone team explored the connection between housing
security and employment by studying how state-level decisions
to sunset eviction moratoriums impacted unemployment rates.
The team hypothesized that expiring moratoriums increased
unemployment rates as individuals contended with possible
evictions and housing instability, taking time away from labor.
The team’s research utilized Callaway & Sant’Anna’s difference-in-
difference methodology with staggered treatment, as well as state-
and county-level data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census
Bureau, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The team’s
preliminary results found that states that lifted their moratoriums
as early as possible displayed evidence of increased unemployment
rates, indicating that the loss of these protections is associated with
a negative impact on labor markets. The team’s final report details
the study’s findings, providing a preliminary assessment of policy
implications for tenant protections and labor market outcomes.",RQA,"Erilia Wu

2064,RIGHT TO COUNSEL AND ILLEGAL EVICTION,"ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF NYC’S RIGHT TO COUNSEL LAWS ON RATES
OF ILLEGAL EVICTION","In 2017, the City of New York began a five-year, staggered rollout
of its landmark Right to Counsel (RTC) legislation, providing free
legal representation to tenants facing eviction. While previous
studies suggest that RTC lowers eviction rates, stakeholders report
that landlords may continue to force tenants out through extralegal
means. Hypothesizing that RTC may have incentivized landlords
to avoid the court system, the Capstone team investigated rates of
attempted illegal eviction via utility shutoffs before and after the
RTC policy change. Using publicly available data from the NYC
Department of Housing Preservation and Development on utility
shutoff violations between 2013 and 2019 as a proxy for illegal
evictions, the team employed a Callaway & Sant’Anna multiperiod
difference-in-difference model to assess whether violation rates
changed significantly at the ZIP code or census tract level after
neighborhoods gained access to RTC. The final report details the
team’s findings, with conclusions tailored to the current push for
statewide expansion of the program.",RQA,"Erilia Wu
